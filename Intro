ðŸŒŸ Exciting Excel Dashboarding Journey! ðŸŒŸ

I recently completed an exercise on Gen Z Aspiration Data, where I created interactive dashboards using Excel. These dashboards provide valuable insights into the aspirations of Gen Z. By employing data visualization techniques and Excel functions, I could present the data effectively.

This exercise has significantly enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills, and I'm excited to continue exploring this field. 
A big thank you KultureHire who supported me on this journey!
